# Slot Element Guide - Slot Game Project

This project is designed to study and test the fundamental principles of slot machine design. It is based on examples from the *Slot Element Guide* and includes pay tables, symbols, and game mechanics.

## Project Contents

- **Par Sheet Analysis:** Pay tables and symbols used in the slot game.
- **Simulation:** Testing game mechanics and analyzing payout distributions.
- **Code Structure:** Developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Files

- `slot_element_guide.ipynb`: The core version of the Slot Element Guide project.
- `slot_element_guide_20line.ipynb`: An extended version with 20 paylines.
- `SlotElementGuide_Parsheet.ods`: Par sheet data for game design.
- `Elements-of-Slot-Design-2nd-Edition.pdf`: A reference document on slot game design.

## How to Use

1. Open and run `slot_element_guide.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Review the symbols and pay tables to understand game mechanics.
3. Run the simulations to analyze the payout distributions.
